Q.1) 1.	What is the fundamental difference between procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms? Provide a brief example to illustrate.
 ans =>  Fundamental Difference Between Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming Paradigms
 Procedural Programming is based on the concept of procedures or functions. It follows a step-by-step approach where the program is divided into functions that operate on data. Data is typically separate from the functions.
 
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), on the other hand, organizes code around objects, which combine both data and the functions that operate on that data. It promotes encapsulation, reusability, and modularity.
 
 | Aspect            | Procedural Programming | Object-Oriented Programming          |
 | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
 | Data & Functions  | Separated              | Bundled inside objects               |
 | Focus             | Functions              | Objects                              |
 | Code Reuse        | Less modular           | Promotes reusability via inheritance |
 | Example Languages | C, Pascal              | C++, Java, Python (OOP features)     |
 
 Procedural Approach (C-style C++):
 #include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
 
 int add(int a, int b) {
     return a + b;
 }
 
 int main() {
     cout << "Sum: " << add(5, 3) << endl;
     return 0;
 }
 
 Object-Oriented Approach (C++):
 #include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
 
 class Calculator {
 public:
     int add(int a, int b) {
         return a + b;
     }
 };
 
 int main() {
     Calculator calc;
     cout << "Sum: " << calc.add(5, 3) << endl;
     return 0;
 }
 
 Q.1) 2.	Define Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). What are its core characteristics?
 ans => Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. These objects contain data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data. OOP models real-world entities and their interactions, making code more reusable, modular, and scalable.
 
 ðŸ’¡ Core Characteristics of OOP
 Encapsulation
 
 Bundles data and methods that operate on the data within a class.
 
 Restricts direct access to some components, promoting data protection.
 
 Abstraction
 
 Hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.
 
 Helps reduce programming complexity.
 
 Inheritance
 
 Allows a class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent).
 
 Promotes code reuse.
 
 Polymorphism
 
 Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.
 
 Supports method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and overriding (same method name and parameters in derived class).
 
 Q.3)	Explain the concept of "abstraction" within the context of OOP. Why is it important?
 ans =>Abstraction means hiding internal implementation details and showing only the necessary functionality to the user.
 
 Why it's important:
 
 Reduces complexity by focusing on relevant details.
 
 Enhances code readability and maintainability.
 
 Supports modularity by separating interface from implementation.
 EX:-
 class Car {
 public:
     void startEngine() {
         // Abstracts complex internal steps like fuel injection, ignition, etc.
         cout << "Engine started." << endl;
     }
 };
 Q.4)	What are the benefits of using OOP over procedural programming?
 ans => Benefits of OOP Over Procedural Programming
 Modularity: Code is organized into classes and objects.
 
 Reusability: Inheritance allows code to be reused across projects.
 
 Maintainability: Easier to modify and debug parts without affecting others.
 
 Real-world modeling: Objects mimic real-world entities.
 
 Extensibility: Easier to add new features with minimal changes.
 Q.5)	Give a real-world example of a problem that is well-suited to be solved using an OOP approach. Explain why.
 ans => Real-World Problem Suited for OOP: Library Management System
 Why OOP?
 
 Entities like Book, Member, Librarian, and Loan can be modeled as objects.
 
 Shared behaviors (e.g., borrowing, returning books) can be defined in base classes.
 
 Encapsulation secures data like member details.
 
 Inheritance helps differentiate roles (e.g., Member vs. Librarian).
 
 Easier to extend the system with new features like fines, e-books, or memberships.
 
 
 Q.6)	Define the four key principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
 ans => Four Key Principles of OOP
 Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods; restricts direct access.
 
 Inheritance: One class derives from another, reusing its properties/methods.
 
 Polymorphism: One interface, multiple implementations.
 
 Abstraction: Hiding internal complexity; exposing only necessary parts.
 
 
 Q.7)	Explain how encapsulation helps to protect data and create modular code. Give an example using a class and its members.
 ans => Encapsulation
 Encapsulation protects an objectâ€™s state by exposing only selected components through accessors (getters/setters).
 
 Example:
 class BankAccount {
 private:
     double balance;
 
 public:
     void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
     double getBalance() const { return balance; }
 };
 Benefits:
 
 Prevents direct modification of data.
 
 Enables controlled access.
 
 Supports modular code.
 
 Q.8)	What is inheritance? How does it promote code reuse and maintainability? Provide a simple example using classes.
 ans => Inheritance
 Definition: Inheritance allows a class (child) to derive attributes and behavior from another class (parent).
 
 Example:
 class Vehicle {
 public:
     void move() { cout << "Moving..." << endl; }
 };
 
 class Car : public Vehicle {
 public:
     void honk() { cout << "Beep Beep!" << endl; }
 };
 Benefits:
 
 Promotes code reuse.
 
 Improves maintainability.
 
 Facilitates hierarchical classifications.
 Q.9)	Describe polymorphism. How does it contribute to flexibility and extensibility in software design? Give examples of function/operator overloading and function overriding.
 ans =>  Polymorphism
 Definition: Allows the same function name to behave differently depending on context.
 
 Types:
 
 Compile-time (Overloading):
 
 int add(int a, int b);
 double add(double a, double b);
 
 Run-time (Overriding):
 
 class Shape {
 public:
     virtual void draw() { cout << "Drawing shape" << endl; }
 };
 class Circle : public Shape {
 public:
     void draw() override { cout << "Drawing circle" << endl; }
 };
 
 class Shape {
 public:
     virtual void draw() { cout << "Drawing shape" << endl; }
 };
 class Circle : public Shape {
 public:
     void draw() override { cout << "Drawing circle" << endl; }
 };
 
 Q.10)	Explain the difference between "overloading" and "overriding".
 ans => 
 | Feature      | Overloading                               | Overriding                                  |
 | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
 | Occurs in    | Same class                                | Parent-child class relationship             |
 | Purpose      | Same method name, different parameters    | Redefine base class method in derived class |
 | Binding Time | Compile-time                              | Run-time                                    |
 | Example      | `add(int, int)` vs. `add(double, double)` | `draw()` in base vs. derived class          |
Q.11) List at least three advantages of using OOP in software development.
ans => 
Advantages of Using OOP in Software Development
Modularity: Code is divided into classes/objects, making it easier to manage and maintain.

Reusability: Classes and methods can be reused through inheritance.

Scalability and Extensibility: New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

Data Security: Encapsulation hides internal states and protects data.

Real-World Modeling: OOP allows developers to represent real-world systems naturally.
Q.12) Give examples of application domains where OOP is commonly used (e.g., GUI development, game programming, etc.).
ans => 
Application Domains Where OOP is Commonly Used
Game Development: Entities like Player, Enemy, Weapon as objects.

Graphical User Interfaces (GUI): Windows, buttons, and menus are objects.

Simulation and Modeling: Car simulations, factory models, etc.

Enterprise Applications: Banking, inventory, HR systems.

Mobile App Development: Activities and components are class-based.

Q.13) Discuss the impact of OOP on code maintainability and reusability.
ans =>
 Impact of OOP on Code Maintainability and Reusability
Maintainability: Classes isolate functionality, so bugs are easier to locate and fix.

Reusability: Base classes can be reused across different programs, reducing duplication.

Modifiability: Polymorphism allows changing behaviors without altering the interface.


Q.14) How does OOP contribute to the development of large and complex software systems?
ans =>
How OOP Supports Large and Complex Software Systems
Hierarchical Class Structures: Easier to organize and navigate code.

Encapsulation: Modules can be developed independently.

Design Patterns: OOP allows use of patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory) for architecture.

Team Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on separate classes/modules.
Q.15) Explain the benefits of using OOP in software development.
ans => 
Benefits of Using OOP in Software Development
Improved code structure and organization.

Easier troubleshooting and bug-fixing.

Promotes best practices like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Enhances software lifecycle management.

Simplifies unit testing and integration.
Q.16) Describe the basic structure of a C++ program. What are the essential components?
ans => #include <iostream>   // Preprocessor directive

using namespace std; // Namespace declaration

int main() {         // Main function
    cout << "Hello, world!"; // Output statement
    return 0;        // Exit code
}
Essential Components:

Preprocessor directives (#include)

Namespace declaration

Main function: Entry point

Statements: Executable code

Return statement


Q.17) Explain the purpose of namespaces in C++. How do they help to avoid naming conflicts?
ans =>
Purpose of Namespaces in C++
Namespaces prevent naming conflicts by logically grouping code.

Example:

namespace MyApp {
    void display() {
        cout << "Inside MyApp";
    }
}
MyApp::display(); // Avoids clash with other 'display()' functions
Theyâ€™re useful when multiple libraries or large teams use similar function or class names.

Q.18) What are identifiers in C++? What rules must be followed when creating them?
ans =>  What Are Identifiers in C++?
Identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, etc.

Rules:

Can include letters (Aâ€“Z, aâ€“z), digits (0â€“9), and underscores.

Must not start with a digit.

Cannot use C++ keywords (like int, return).

Case-sensitive: Age â‰  age.
Q.19) What are the differences between variables and constants in C++? How are they declared?
ans =>
| Feature      | Variables                   | Constants                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Value change | Can change during execution | Cannot change once defined            |
| Declaration  | `int x = 10;`               | `const int x = 10;` or `#define X 10` |

Q.20) Explain how to use control structures (e.g., if-else, for, while) to control the execution flow in a C++ program. Provide a simple code example
ans => 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i;

    // if-else
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> i;
    if (i % 2 == 0)
        cout << "Even number" << endl;
    else
        cout << "Odd number" << endl;

    // for loop
    for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
        cout << j << " ";
    }

    // while loop
    int k = 0;
    while (k < 3) {
        cout << "\nCount: " << k;
        k++;
    }

    return 0;
}
